- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex Lalov
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and creating small but useful applications which help the people around me automize their work, or directly help with workload.
- 🎓I've completed the international baccalaureate (IB) with Math and Physics at high level. I'm currently enrolled in Royal Hollloway, University of London as a bachelor of Computer Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to use a declarative language such as Prolog, the basics of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any public project that might need some help with backend logic and optimization.
